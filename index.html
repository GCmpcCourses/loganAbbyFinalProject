           Spotify Wrapped is a viral marketing campaign by Spotify. 
            Released in early December every year since 2016, 
            the campaign allows Spotify users to view a compilation of data 
            about their activity on the platform over the past year, 
            then invites them to share it on social media.

        <div class = "text">
            Many Spotify users this year were expecting something different than
            what they got. Spotify seemed to have some odd genres such as 
            aggrotech, bubble trance, new weird america, jerk, and wonky.
            When these genres came up on people's wrapped, they were very confused. 
            Along with some weird genres, people were making fun of the graphic design.
            Words were squished together, the phrases were cringe-worthy, and the banner 
            graphic was choppy. Below are some examples of 2021's wrapped controversy.

            However, these weird aspects did not stop the yearly anticipation
            of everyone's Spotify Wrapped. Visit the "Statistics" tab to see
